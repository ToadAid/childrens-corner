# Blue Toby's First Leap

An interactive story where children help Toby hop from lily pad to lily pad — teaching patience, one step at a time.

## How to Play

1. Click on the lily pad closest to Toby to make your first hop
2. Each successful hop reveals a secret ✨
3. Keep hopping until you reach the far lily pad! 🏆

## The Lesson

> "First, you find the pad that's just one hop away. Then another. And another. The pond will carry you the rest of the way."
