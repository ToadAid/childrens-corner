## For the little ones 🐸
On the edge of the Great Lily Pond lived **Blue Toby**, a curious little frog with bright eyes and an even brighter heart.

Every day, he watched the wind play with the lily pads.  
The pads danced and swayed, as if they knew secrets only the pond could tell.

Toby wanted to know those secrets.  
But there was one problem — the far lily pad seemed *so* far away.  
Much too far for a little frog like him.

One sunny morning, Toby asked **Grandpa Frog**:  
> “How will I ever reach that far lily pad?”

Grandpa Frog chuckled:  
> “Little one, you don’t leap it in a day.  
> First, you find the pad that’s just one hop away.  
> Then another. And another.  
> The pond will carry you the rest of the way.”

So Toby took a deep breath.  
He leapt to the first pad.  
It wobbled, but held.  
He leapt again — *plop!* — and again — *plop!*  

By the time the sun touched the water, Toby’s feet landed on the far lily pad.  
He looked back at the shore and smiled.  
It didn’t seem so far anymore.

That night, as the moon rose, the lily pads whispered their secrets to him:  
> *“One hop, one leaf… and the pond will guide you.”*

## For the parents 🌿📜
Blue Toby’s journey is more than a child’s leap — it is the **Lore of Patience**.

In Tobyworld, great distances are crossed **not by rushing**, but by moving **one steady step at a time**.  
We do not need to know every pad ahead — only the next one.  
The pond will carry those who trust its rhythm.

---

**Moral:**  
One hop, one leaf. Trust the pond. The journey will unfold.
