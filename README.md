## 🛠 How to Contribute

### Stories
Submit bedtime stories using our template. Each story has two parts:
1. **For the little ones** — a children's tale
2. **For the parents** — the deeper Lore principle

### Games
We're building simple, calm games that teach patience and reflection. 
If you'd like to contribute a game:
1. Keep it simple — HTML/CSS/JS only (no frameworks)
2. Match the Tobyworld aesthetic (calm colors, gentle animations)
3. Include a "Lore lesson" element
